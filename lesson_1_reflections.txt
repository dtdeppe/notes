How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    much less stuff to sift through.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    easily see diferences over time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pro: don't save when not needed
    con: if you forget to save a commit, you won't have it in history.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    not sure.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    good question.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    easy fallback.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
